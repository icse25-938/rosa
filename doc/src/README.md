# Introduction

This is the documentation of ROSA,[^1] the prototype demonstrating a fuzzing-based backdoor
detection method using metamorphic oracles.

The documentation is split into multiple parts:

- [Installation](./installation.md) - instructions to install ROSA on your machine
- [Quickstart](./quickstart.md) - a quick guide that shows you how to use ROSA to detect backdoors
  with a simple example
- [Configuration guide](./config_guide.md) - an in-depth guide on how to configure ROSA for a
  specific target program
- [How ROSA works](./internals.md) - a discussion of the inner workings of ROSA and the theoretical
  ideas behind it
- [Extending ROSA](./extensions.md) - a guide on how to extend and build upon ROSA


There is also `rustdoc` documentation for the API itself, that can be generated by running the
following command at the root of the ROSA repo:
```console
$ cargo doc
```


[^1]: ROSA is a reference to the song [_El Paso_](

also stands for _Runtime trace Oracle-based Selection Algorithm_.
